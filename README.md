# miyoo-mini-imgs
Thumbnail images generated for the Miyoo Mini.



This is a 1G1R scrape of English no-intro romsets in 256x256 pngs to fit the Miyoo Mini's thumbnail view.

It's no longer in the folder structure that OnionUI's most recent versions use, and I no longer am involved in the Miyoo/Onion scene, so you'll need to do a little file juggling on your own to get them into the new folder structure.

Here are some examples of what to expect.

When pressing the right button on the D-Pad when browsing your games, you can browse via thumbnails which will look as they do below.
